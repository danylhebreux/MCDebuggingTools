# MCDebuggingTools - Extermination helper

Collection of debuging tools that can be added to your project

## Usage

```objective-c
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "MCMemoryWarningGenerators.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
#ifdef DEBUG
  // Force memory warnings to occur every 60 seconds. Helps you ensure you're
  // handling them properly.
  PERFORM_MEMORY_WARNING_AT_INTERVAL(60);
#endif


#ifdef DEBUG
  // Allocate a block of memory every 30 seconds. Helps ensure your application
  // can survive low memory conditions.
  ALLOCATE_MEMORY_BLOCK_AT_INTERNAL(30);
#endif

  return YES;
}
```

### MCMemoryWarrningGenerator
Extremely simple to use tool to simulate low memory conditions in your
application so you can ensure that it behaves correctly when receiving memory
warnings.

```objective-c
// generates a simulated memory warning continuously at the specified interval
// in seconds.
PERFORM_MEMORY_WARNING_AT_INTERVAL(interval);
```

```objective-c
// Allocates blocks of 5MB of memory continuously at the specified interval
// in seconds.
ALLOCATE_MEMORY_BLOCK_AT_INTERNAL(interval)
```

## Adding to your project

If you're using [`CocoaPods`](http://cocoapods.org/), there's nothing simpler.
Add the following to your [`Podfile`](http://docs.cocoapods.org/podfile.html)
and run `pod install`.

```objective-c
pod 'MCDebuggingTools', :git => 'https://github.com/mirego/MCDebuggingTools.git'
```

Don't forget to `#import "MCMemoryWarningGenerators.h"` where it's needed.
